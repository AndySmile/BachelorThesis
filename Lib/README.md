Third Party Libraries
=====================
This directory actually includes third party libraries. 
But to prevent trouble with those licenses of each library, I've decided to not add them in
this repository. So, if you want to compile those application in this repository, go to
those following websites and install those libraries in this directory:

GLM - Math Library - http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html

Libraries which aren't located within this directory:
SFML Framework - http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php

Those applications were developed and tested with SFML v.2.1.
