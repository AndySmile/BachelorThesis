Unit Tests
===========
All source code files for unit tests are located here. I'm using CppUnit v1.12.1, so it's necessary that you have it installed to be able
to run those test cases on your machine.

To start unit testing go to the DemoApp directory and enter:

	make test

Afterwards it'll compile the entire source code including all test cases and instantly run those test cases. You will receive the
test case result at the end.
