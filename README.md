#BachelorThesis
==============
This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis. 
I'm currently working only in the Dev branch because this project is still work in progress.
Not all features are implemented and neither it's a stable version. After all features are right in place
and are stable, it'll move to the master branch. So, the latest stable version will be always in the master
branch and all the latest features, bugfixes and so on will be in the Dev branch. 

BE CAREFUL USING THE VERSION WITHIN DEV BRANCH!

##Unit Testing
===============
This project includes test suites which will be compiled and executed by CppUnit. To do so just go to the
project directory within your terminal and enter:

make test

That'll create a separated executable for unit testing and it'll start right after it was build.
