#Prototypes

Before I've starting working on a feature for the main application "DemoApp", I've tested it within a separated
prototype application. It's rough code, but it makes it quite easy to figure out how the feature has to get implemented
to work the way I want it to, basically. 

##ImageParameter

This prototype was build for all image analytics features and to figure out how to get the information I need to finally build a terrain
base on those information.

##MeshTerrainDemo

This prototype has a rough implementation to render a terrain as a big mesh which is based on a height-map.

##PerlinNoiseDemo

It was planed to build in a feature which is based on the Perlin Noise algorithm. But unfortunatelly there weren't time left
to actually build it. So, this project is quite empty.

##VoxelTerainDemo

This prototype implements a terrain renderer which builds the terrain based on voxel. It works quite well but there isn't any performance
optimisation, so if you build a large terrain, you're actually able to count each frame.
